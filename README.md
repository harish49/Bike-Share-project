# BikeShare project
This project is a part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Program. This project is based on Python script which imports CSV files related to the bikeshare data of 3 cities Newyork, Washington and Chicago . The script performs various descriptive statistics on the data.
It takes queries from users and provides the statistical information as output . The script uses powerful modules like  Numpy and  Pandas which make the computation more effective.

# Future Scope
I will try to develop this project as an application which makes very easy to use .
